Hello and Welcome! I am currently a third-year PhD student in [Statistics](https://statistics.gmu.edu/) at the [College of Engineering and Computing](https://cec.gmu.edu/), [George Mason University](https://www2.gmu.edu). I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [David Kepplinger](https://www.dkepplinger.org/) and Professor [Lily Wang](https://sites.google.com/view/lilywang/). My research focuses on developing robust (non-)parametric statistical methods and efficient algorithms for linear regression, spatial data, and hyper-spectral images.

Before coming to GMU, I have lived in New York City for four years where I worked as a quantitative research associate for a hedge fund and earned my master’s degree in statistics from [CUNY – Baruch College](https://zicklin.baruch.cuny.edu/academic-programs/graduate/ms/statistics/). Prior to that, I obtained an MS in Finance degree from the [University of Rochester](https://simon.rochester.edu/) and a Bachelor’s degree in Finance from [Zhongnan University of Economics and Law](http://www.zuel.edu.cn/).

<!-- <p style="color:var(--global-text-color)" align="justify"> -->
My research interests include robust statistical methods, non-/semi-parametric methods, statistical optimization, time series analysis, and functional data analysis.
