<!-- Welcome! I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in **[Statistics](https://statistics.gmu.edu/)** at **[George Mason University](https://www2.gmu.edu)**, mentored by **[Dr. David Kepplinger](https://www.dkepplinger.org/)** and **[Dr. Lily Wang](https://sites.google.com/view/lilywang/)**. My dissertation research focuses on developing robust nonparametric estimation and inference methods for medical imaging data and hyper-spectral images. My research interests include robust statistical methods, non-/semi-parametric methods, statistical optimization, time series analysis, and functional data analysis. Prior to my academic journey, I earned master's degrees in statistics from **[CUNY -- Baruch College](https://zicklin.baruch.cuny.edu/academic-programs/graduate/ms/statistics/)** and in finance from **[University of Rochester](https://simon.rochester.edu/)**.  -->

<!-- I have also worked as a quantitative research associate for a hedge fund.  -->

<!-- Before coming to GMU, I have lived in New York City for four years where I worked as a quantitative research associate for a hedge fund and earned my master’s degree in statistics from **[CUNY – Baruch College](https://zicklin.baruch.cuny.edu/academic-programs/graduate/ms/statistics/)**. Prior to that, I obtained an MS in Finance degree from the **[University of Rochester](https://simon.rochester.edu/)** and a Bachelor’s degree in Finance from **[Zhongnan University of Economics and Law](http://www.zuel.edu.cn/)**. -->
